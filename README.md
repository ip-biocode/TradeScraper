The Python code does the following:
1. Uses bulk API to scrape international goods trade data from UN Comtrade (https://comtrade.un.org/).
2. Cleans and matches country names with official international country codes.
3. Merges with international service trade data.
4. Ultimately creates one large dataset containing all of world's bilateral trade in goods and services, 2000-2014.
